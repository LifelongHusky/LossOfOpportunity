    You continue to look around, trying to find more evidence to back up your 
conclusions, when you suddenly get a message from your home planet.

               LMSK-19 IS UNSTABLE.  LEAVE IMMEDIATELY.
                         -PROFESSOR AUREOLE

    You run to the ship, Fang in tow, rushing to leave the planet.  As fun as it would 
be to continue investigating LMSK-19, it was not worth your lives.
    You make it back to your ship safely, and fly back to your home planet, excited to tell everyone of what you had learned.
