    You glance out the window at the planet. It’s covered in red-brown dirt and rocks. It 
doesn’t look like there’s any technology that could have transmitted the signal.
    PT: “Are you sure this is where the transmission came from? It doesn’t look like 
anything came from here.”
    Greg: “Maybe the people live underground on this planet.”
    PT: “I suppose there’s only one way to find out.”
    You check the display on the ship. It senses that the atmosphere requires some 
protective equipment. It senses low amounts of atmosphere, non-negligible radiation 
and cold temperatures.
    After everyone has the proper protective equipment on, you disembark. You think you 
see something glinting in the distance. Fang barks decisively, indicating a different 
direction.
