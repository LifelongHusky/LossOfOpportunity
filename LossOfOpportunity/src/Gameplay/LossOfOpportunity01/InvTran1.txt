Investigate the Transmission

    The source of the signal seems to be a relay of an incoming transmission from 
the original base of the robot. Further investigation reveals the source to be from 
a nearby planet.
    Greg: “The source of the transmission can be narrowed down further from just 
a nearby planet. It appears to be a highly advanced station. In fact, if you give me 
some time, I may be able to find the exact coordinates of the original 
transmission.”
    You nod. The exact coordinates would be an excellent source to start 
investigating.
