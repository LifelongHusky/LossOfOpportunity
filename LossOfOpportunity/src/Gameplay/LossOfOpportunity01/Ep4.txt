LMSK-19: SUMMARY OF EVENTS

    After the 236 day research mission of planet LMSK- 19, much has been 
discovered about the inhabitants, their culture, and why the planet is empty.
    LMSK-19 is known was known as Earth to its late inhabitants, who referred to 
themselves as humans.  Our journey started after intercepting a signal sent to a robot 
called Opportunity--a rover they sent to another planet for research purposes.  While 
visiting a town called Paris, and investigating a satellite called the Eiffel Tower, we came 
to the conclusion that the humans left their home planet to explore.  Only one launch 
pad was found, implying that much of the population was left on the home planet.  This 
could have been due to the fact that only a small portion of humans wanted to explore, 
while many wanted to stay on the planet.
    Our findings suggest that humans left their home planet to explore the galaxy, but 
left Earth, and the majority of humans, to die, with no intention of coming back.
