[Day 259 continued]

    You land in a deserted town, no sign of life for miles. The ship indicates that the 
atmosphere is close to that of your home planet, but there are high levels of radiation 
and higher than average temperatures. You would need to use protective equipment to 
explore the area.  You suit up and exit the ship, noticing that the village has evidence of 
a battle. Maybe this is why the village was abandoned. The walls are filled with small holes, 
while some walls are just gone all together.  Fang sniffs at the ground, growling at a red 
splatter.  You scan, finding that it is dead organic matter.
    You walk towards the building you came to investigate, finding that the door is 
open.  Fang finds the stairs and starts to walk down them, looking behind him to make 
sure you are following.
    You reach the lowest floor of the building, finally finding all of the technology that 
your scanner detected.  The technology has been out of use for a long time.  You start 
to scan the machine, hoping to find out what, or who, could have brought down an entire planet.
    The scanner finishes.  Unfortunately, there isn’t much information, but the data 
the scanner was able to decipher shows that multiple missiles were launched, some 
from this building, and some at this building.   Some of the data suggests that there 
were missiles the original inhabitants of this planet considered highly dangerous, but 
they had all been launched.  But not even their most deadly weapons were able to 
defeat these enemies, it seems.
    While it confused you as to why such events took place, it was obvious that the
 inhabitants of LMSK-19 were attacked and forced into extinction by an alien species.
