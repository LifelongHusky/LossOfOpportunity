    You arrive at the coordinates.  While this building looks as run-down as the others, it’s 
obvious that the people that lived here took good care of this area.
    Greg: “This is it, where the signal originally came from.  If we go inside, we might be 
able to find out more about this planet.”
    Following Greg’s advice, you go inside what looks like the main building.  You wander 
around for a bit until you find a giant room filled with technology, much more advanced 
than what any other evidence suggested this species had.  Your scanner isn’t able to 
get much from this computer, but it is able to to uncover a bunch of information about 
the planet’s general environment.  Apparently, the planet was experiencing major 
changes while the inhabitants were still here.  The temperatures were becoming more 
varied, and the atmosphere protecting the planet started to deteriorate.  By the time the 
people realized the cause, there was nothing they could do to stop the inevitable 
extinction of their species.  It seems like they uploaded as much information as they 
could onto these computers, just in case anyone ever wanted to know about their 
culture.
    Greg: “So they died because the planet died?  There is some poetic beauty in that.  
Dying with the planet that gave you life.”
    You nodded in agreement. But as tragically beautiful as it is, it didn’t negate the fact 
that their own recklessness was their, and their home’s, undoing.
