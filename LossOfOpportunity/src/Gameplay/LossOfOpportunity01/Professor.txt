    Professor Aureole: “How did downloading the transmission go? What did you 
find?”
    PT: “It seems to be in a foreign script. I can’t read it.”
    Professor Aureole: “Well, this isn’t exactly an unexpected hiccup. Greg can 
recover the coordinates. Perhaps going there and studying the species will help you 
translate the script. You could even write your final paper on this discovery!”
    PT: "It would be interesting, but are you suggesting I go to this planet?"
    Professor Aureole: “Yes, I really think you should!  You could probably go with 
Greg. Having an expert in technology could also help you learn more about the planet. 
Of course, if you feel unsafe, you do not have to go. I don’t want to force you into a 
potentially dangerous situation.”
