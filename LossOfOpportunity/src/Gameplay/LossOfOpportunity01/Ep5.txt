LMSK-19: SUMMARY OF EVENTS

    After the 236 day research mission of planet LMSK- 19, much has been discovered 
about the inhabitants, their culture, and why the planet is empty.
    LMSK-19 is known was known as Earth to its late inhabitants, who referred to 
themselves as humans.  Our journey started after intercepting a signal sent to a robot 
called Opportunity--a rover they sent to another planet for research purposes.  While 
visiting a military base in the continent of Africa, we discovered evidence that the 
humans had been fighting with another alien species, using extremely lethal missiles.  
The radiation levels on the planet imply that these missiles were nuclear.
    Our findings suggest that humans were forced into extinction by nuclear warfare.
