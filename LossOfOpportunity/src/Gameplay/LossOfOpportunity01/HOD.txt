   Head of Department: “The transmission finished uploading?  Finally!  I was just 
starting to think you made the whole thing up. What does it say?”
   PT: “I can’t tell, it’s in a foreign language. I was wondering if you could help me figure 
out what it says.”
   Head of Department: “Of course the anthropology computers couldn’t translate it.  
Here, let me take a look.”
   Head of Department: “This transmission is an absolute mess!  But, I was at least able 
to get coordinates.  Seems like this came from a nearby solar system.”
   PT: “Of course.  But what do you think the transmission could mean?  Do you think 
they could be in trouble?  Could the transmission be their last hope of survival?  What 
if--”
   Head of Department: “If you’re so worried about them, why don’t you go look for 
them?  It would be great research for your final paper.”
   PT: “Isn’t that a little dangerous?  Going to a foreign planet without knowing if the 
species is hostile?”
  Head of Department: “Yes, but studying this species could save the anthropology 
department.  I’ll give you all of the information we have on the planet, I hope this helps.”
