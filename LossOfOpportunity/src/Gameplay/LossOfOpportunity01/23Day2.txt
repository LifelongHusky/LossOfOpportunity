Journal Entry: Day 23, Year 2319

    Your ship is finally ready. It actually all went a lot smoother than you thought, you 
guess the Head of the Department pulled some strings. You hurry towards where it is 
waiting for you with Fang, the pet your parents got you for grad school, following at your 
heels. He yaps happily and wags his tail, energized by your excitement. 
    When you get to the ship, the Head of the Department looks at Fang disdainfully.
    Head of Department: “I never understood why people would bring their pet along on an 
important scientific mission.  They take up valuable resources”
    PT: “Don’t worry sir, he’s incredibly well trained.”
    Head of department: “I suppose it will be fine. Remember, you will have access to all the 
university’s files within the harddrive in your ship. Good luck with your research, and 
remember, the anthropology program is depending on you.”
