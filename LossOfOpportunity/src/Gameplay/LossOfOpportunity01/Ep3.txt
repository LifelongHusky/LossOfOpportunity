LMSK-19: SUMMARY OF EVENTS

    After the 236 day research mission of planet LMSK- 19, much has been 
discovered about the inhabitants, their culture, and why the planet is empty.
    LMSK-19 is known was known as Earth to its late inhabitants, who referred to 
themselves as humans.  Our journey started after intercepting a signal sent to a robot 
called Opportunity--a rover they sent to another planet for research purposes.  While 
visiting a facility the humans referred to as NASA, we discovered evidence that Earth’s 
climate had been changing rapidly in the years before their extinction.  This rapid 
climate change was referred to Global Warming by the humans, though the majority of 
humans remained ignorant to Global Warming until it was too late.  Surprisingly, it 
seems that the humans were the cause of Global Warming, but were unable to correct 
their wrongdoings in time to save themselves from extinction.
   Our findings suggest that the humans were wiped out by Global Warming.
