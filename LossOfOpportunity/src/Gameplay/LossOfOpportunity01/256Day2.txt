    You glance out the window at the planet. It’s covered in red-brown dirt and rocks. The 
planet doesn’t look like there’s any technology that could have transmitted the signal. You 
never know, though.
    You check the display on the ship. It senses that the atmosphere requires some 
protective equipment. It senses low amounts of atmosphere, non-negligible radiation 
and cold temperatures.
    After you and Fang has the proper protective equipment on, you disembark. You think 
you see something glinting in the distance. Fang barks decisively, indicating a different 
direction.
