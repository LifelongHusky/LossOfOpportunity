    You followed the coordinates to a nearby planet.  You took satellite images of the 
planet and found what looks like a giant satellite.  While the satellite was the only 
noticeable image, scans show that a simple-looking building holds enormous amounts 
of technology within it.  
    Greg: “Don’t forget, we can also go to the coordinate we found in the dead robot.  
There’s an area close by where we can land.”
    Where should you land?
