Journal Entry: Day 23, Year 2319

    Your ship is finally ready. It actually all went a lot smoother than you thought, you 
guess Professor Aureole pulled some strings. You hurry towards where the ship is 
waiting for you with Fang, the pet your parents got you for grad school, following at your 
heels. He yaps happily and wags his tail, energized by your excitement.
    As you approach the ship, you see Fang excitedly greeting Professor Aureole.
    Professor Aureole: “Oh, what a good boy! I feel like it’s been so long since I’ve seen 
him. He’s certainly grown PT.”
    PT: “He certainly has! Is Greg here and ready to go?”
    Professor Aureole: “I think Greg was just doing a final inspection of the ship. He 
seems to think he’s the only one that he can trust with electronics.”
    Greg: “If I have to go in this ancient death trap for scientific discovery, I will, but I’d 
prefer a ship that wasn’t created the same year my grandfather was born.”
    PT: “Ancient doesn’t mean dysfunctional. You can learn so much from things that 
existed before you.”
    Greg: “That is exactly what my grandfather would say when he wanted me to listen to 
him.”
    PT: “I’m guessing that means it didn’t work.”
    Professor Aureole: “PT has a point you know. Either way, you two-”
    Fang: “Ruff!”
    Professor Aureole: “Sorry, three, should be off. I wish you the best of luck on your 
mission, and I truly hope you discover something extraordinary.”
