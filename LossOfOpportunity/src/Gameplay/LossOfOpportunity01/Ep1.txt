LMSK-19: SUMMARY OF EVENTS

    After the 236 day research mission of planet LMSK- 19, much has been 
discovered about the inhabitants, their culture, and why the planet is empty.
    LMSK-19 is known was known as Earth to its late inhabitants, who referred to 
themselves as humans.  Our journey started after intercepting a signal sent to a robot 
called Opportunity--a rover they sent to another planet for research purposes.  While 
visiting a town called Paris, and investigating a satellite called the Eiffel Tower,
    We came to the conclusion that the humans left their home planet to explore.  
Though only one launch site was found, there is a good chance that there were multiple 
launch pads scattered across Earth.
    Our findings suggest that humans left their home planet to explore the galaxy, but 
left Earth in ruins, with no intention of coming back.
