    You let Fang lead you to what he had discovered. He stops by a divet in the face of 
the planet. It branches out like rivers. Out of curiosity, you test the soil. It reads in ways 
that correlate with water having flown there once. The planet is too cold for flowing 
water now, and there is no sign of it in the valley. If there was water, where did it go? 
Why did the temperature change so dramatically?
