Huh? That's weird.
As you were checking the lab computers one of the computers has received a transmission.
Most of the time it's just checking for malware or viruses, and getting Greg to get rid of malware that has appeared.
The computers are constantly searching for signals, but rarely find anything.
You are glad to find a transmission, as the anthropology department is only kept operating by Professor Aureole.
Uploading it will take a while, so you can do other chores while you wait. 

Professor Aureole: "Getting everything done early today, huh PT?
Oh? What's that pinging the computer?"

PT: "A transmission.
I have to upload it to our servers before I can look at it.
It's exciting, we haven't gotten new information from space in a long time."

Professor Aureole: "Indeed.
Perhaps you can even investigate a new culture.
Ah, the life of a young anthropologist, how I envy you.
I have to go teach my class, but I hope you discover something truly important."

After the professor leaves, you check the transmission.
Upload: 59%.
You may as well start putting away the books people borrowed, returned and didnï¿½t return to their proper places.
Does no one appreciate this program?

Head of department: "Ah, PT, are the computers running fine?"

PT: "Yes, actually, we just received a signal."

Head of department: "That's good, it looks like those computers were left here for something after all.
Who knows, if it's anything of value the anthropology program could be given more funding for research.
I was looking for Professor Aureole, but I forgot he's teaching his class.
Best of luck with the transmission."

Finally, it's finished uploading.

Of course the language is so different from our own, it's pretty much unreadable.
Maybe learning about the people group this transmission is from would help you read it.
But who should you ask?
Professor Aureole would be more than happy to give you the materials you need
But the head of the department would be able to give access to the archives to help us learn about the new planet...
