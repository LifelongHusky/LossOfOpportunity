Professor Aureole: "How did downloading the transmission go? What did you find?"
PT: "It seems to be in a foreign script. I can't read it."
Professor Aureole: "Well, this isn't exactly an unexpected hiccup. Greg can recover the
coordinates. Perhaps going there and studying the species will help you translate the 
script. You could even write your final paper on this discovery!"
PT: "It would be interesting, but wouldn't it be dangerous to go an unknown planet on
my own?"
Professor Aureole: "You could probably go with Greg. Having an expert in technology
could also help you learn more about the planet. Of course, if you still feel unsafe, you 
do not have to go. I don't want to force you into a potentially dangerous situation."
